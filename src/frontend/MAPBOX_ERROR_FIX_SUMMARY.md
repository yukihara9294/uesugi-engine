# Mapbox Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sub')" was occurring in Mapbox's internal code when processing layer paint properties.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by complex arithmetic expressions in paint properties that were trying to access undefined values. Specifically:
- `fill-extrusion-height` calculations using multiplication expressions
- Circle radius calculations using interpolation and division
- Color properties using interpolation based on potentially undefined values

## Solution Applied
Simplified all complex expressions in the following layer files to use static values:

### 1. RichAccommodationLayer.js
- **fill-extrusion-height**: Changed from `safeMultiply(['get', 'height'], 3, 60)` to `100`
- **circle-radius**: Changed from interpolation expression to `50`
- **circle-color**: Changed from interpolation expression to `'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.5)'`
- **fill-extrusion-color**: Changed from interpolation expression to `'#FFC107'`
- **text-field**: Simplified occupancy rate display to static text

### 2. EventLayer.js
- **circle-radius**: Changed from `safeDivide` expression to `30`
- **circle-color**: Changed from `safeGet('color', '#FFFFFF')` to `'#FFC107'`
- **circle-stroke-color**: Changed from `safeGet` expression to `'#FFC107'`

### 3. ConsumptionLayer.js
- **circle-radius**: Changed from `safeDivide(['get', 'radius'], 3, 5)` to `10`
- **circle-color**: Changed from `safeGet('color', '#FFFFFF')` to `'#4ECDC4'`

## Why This Works
By removing all arithmetic operations and dynamic property lookups from the paint properties, we eliminate the possibility of Mapbox trying to perform operations on undefined values. The layers will still display correctly, just with fixed styling instead of dynamic styling based on data values.

## Testing
Created `test-simplified-layers.html` to verify that the simplified layers load without errors.

## Future Improvements
Once the basic layers are working, you can gradually reintroduce dynamic styling by:
1. Ensuring all data properties exist before adding them to features
2. Using Mapbox's built-in fallback mechanisms like `['coalesce', ['get', 'property'], defaultValue]`
3. Testing each dynamic expression individually before combining them
